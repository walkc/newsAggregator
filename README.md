# newsAggregator

In this assignment, we were tasked with building a news aggregator with autocomplete functionality. The news aggregator pulls a number of prominent RSS feeds, and displays the most prominent words across the feeds. The user can then search (with autocomplete) for specific terms to view news with that term. The GUI for this project was provided for me, I did not build it. This project was built in Java.
